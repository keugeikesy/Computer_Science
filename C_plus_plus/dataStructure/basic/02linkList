    *   tips
    *   1、pointer filed not means you just use only one,you can use many point if you really need.
    *   2、pointer job is to point a Memory that we use function of malloc() to get.
    *   3、If a poniter  not point to a Memory,please make it point to NULL.
    *   4、If you don't need the Memory which you have been apply from the Operating System by malloc(),please use function of free() to release it.

|      we can use this struct to realize many DataStructe        |

|        Graph                                                   |
